Nvidia Driver ****451.48**** is out June 24, 2020. 
In combination with the massive new ****Windows 10 May Feature Update (version 2004)****, we now have this: 
*Hardware-Accelerated Gpu Scheduling*
```According to Microsoft themselves, the GPU scheduling feature allows a graphics card to directly manage its video memory, which in turn significantly improves performance of the minimum and average FPS and thereby, reducing latency.```
The other advantage to having this is that now you can ****finally use multiple monitors that have different refresh rates at the same time****. Previously, if you were gaming at 144hz on your main monitor, and have *ANY* animation (blinking icon, video playing, etc) on the secondary monitor which could be 60hz, your primary monitor would drop to below 100hz. 
This is now fixed.

*Other features include:*
- **DirectX 12 Ultimate**
- **Vulkan 1.2**
- **CUDA 11.0**

These new features comes with WDDM2.7 which comes with Windows 10 2004 in combination with the new Nvida Driver. 

You **NEED** the New Windows 10 (version 2004) (If the Windows version does not say 2004, you must keep updating until you get 2004) update, And you also **NEED** this new driver.

If you're not on both the new driver and new windows, *it will not work.*
You may need to use the **Windows Update Tool** if running Windows Update does not show you the update OR if it says "not ready". There is NO PROBLEM with using this Tool.
